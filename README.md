Code and 3D files for the LED Equalizer

I took lots of inspiration from Scott Marleys ESP32 Matrix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgh2WblO5_c&t=480s, but custom coded all my functions and features.

For some reason, you need to use espressif ESP32 version 1.0.4 with arduino to get a quick enough ADC conversion time to sample audio.

All connections are fairly simple and pin definitions for the button and microphone can be changed.
